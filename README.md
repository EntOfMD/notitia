## How to install?

-   Start with cloning the repo. Type `git clone https://github.com/EntOfMD/notitia.git` in the directory you want NOTITIA FOLDER on.

-   Make sure there isn't a `package.json` && `package-lock.json` && `node_modules` anywhere in the project.
-   Open up terminal and change directory into the main folder. After that, type `npm install` in the console, and let it install necessary packages in `package.json` file to your machine.

-   Then change directory to `client`, and follow the same steps above, `npm install`. This will install the react(client side).

-   Change directory again to main folder (NOTITIA)and then start the server with `npm run dev` for Development (package.json will install [Concurrently](https://www.npmjs.com/package/concurrently).
    This will start both the Node server AND React server. It's mainly to live preview the changes.

# Missing Files

-   Should there be missing files, delete `node_modules` && `package.json` && `package-lock.json` and run `npm install` once more.

## Some files are too important to share, such as server keys, database keys, etc. They were omitted purposefully. As a developer, I encourage you to find a way to overcome the issues.
