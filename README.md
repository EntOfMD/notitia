# Notitia - Age of Information


----
### Are you a product owner who has seen a drop of users on your app? Wait no longer!


This app is to help you out. Notitia will ask feedback from your users and display the results in an easy to read, and detailed graph. With these results, you can take the feedback and improve your app even further! This is the age of information, we are here to give you a means to get that information. Take it and succeed!

## About

This app uses credit based email sending, which the developer can charge however you want, typically there are free ones, but we're pouring our hearts into this and there's a worth on it. I (EntOfMD) currently work with new startups with limited funding, so we're helping each other out by using this service (Supporting us makes us efficient, which means more frequent updates and features!)

## How to install?

* Start off with `npm install` in your console, and let it install necessary packages in `package.json` file to your machine.
* [Optional] If you are familiar with `nodemon`, you can run it, but we're using `supervisor` and to install it, run `npm i supervisor -g` into the console and let it install globally. 

----
## Agreement

Any future developer who wants to use this MUST agree to not use this software for illegal and/or in a way the developer profits directly without benefits for the program users(app owners). Future developers must also agree to not misplace/edit/copy/steal ANY sensitive information, security is a top priority.
